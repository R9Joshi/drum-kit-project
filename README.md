# Drum Kit Project üéµ

This is a fun and interactive **Drum Kit Project** created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to play drum sounds by either clicking on drum buttons or pressing specific keys on the keyboard.

## Features ü•Å

- **Interactive UI**: Buttons styled with CSS to mimic a drum kit.
- **Keyboard Support**: Play drum sounds by pressing keys (`W`, `A`, `S`, `D`, `J`, `K`, `L`).
- **Event Handling**: Leveraged JavaScript `eventListener` for both `click` and `keydown` events.
- **Reusable Functionality**: Implemented a `playSound()` function for modularity.
- **Dynamic Sound Playback**: Each button/key triggers a unique sound.

## What I Learned üìö

This project helped me solidify the following JavaScript concepts:

1. **`querySelector` and `querySelectorAll`**:
   - Used to select HTML elements dynamically.
   - Example: Selecting all buttons with the class `.drum`.

2. **`addEventListener`**:
   - Learned how to handle `click` and `keydown` events.
   - Example: Adding event listeners to each drum button for interaction.

3. **`this` Keyword**:
   - Understood how `this` refers to the element that triggered the event.
   - Example: Identifying the clicked button dynamically.

4. **Switch Statements**:
   - Used to map specific keys/buttons to corresponding drum sounds.

5. **Audio API**:
   - Played sounds dynamically using the `Audio` object in JavaScript.

6. **Debugging Techniques**:
   - Fixed issues using `console.log()` to debug keypresses and button clicks.
